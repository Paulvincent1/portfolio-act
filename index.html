            Welcome to my web developer portfolio! I'm Paul, a dedicated student
            with a passion for web development. Throughout my journey, I've
            successfully completed two notable projects. The first one is "Upang
            Transport It!" - a truck booking platform. The second project is
            "Paw Adopt Paw" - a website and mobile app dedicated to pet
            adoption. Additionally, during my 1st years in college, I developed
            a Java game called "Tic Tac Toe."

            <strong>Specialization in Backend Development:</strong> I specialize
            in backend development, ensuring that the server-side of web and
            mobile applications operates smoothly. From managing databases to
            handling server logic, I excel in creating robust and scalable
            backend solutions.
